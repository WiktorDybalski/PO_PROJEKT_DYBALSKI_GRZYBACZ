# Darwin World Simulator

The "Darwin World Simulator" project is a simulation of an ecosystem that lets users explore how evolution works in nature by doing interactive experiments and adjusting the world's parameters


## Start Panel:

### At the heart of this simulation is the Start Panel, which serves as the gateway for users to customize their simulation experience. This panel includes various input values that can be adjusted to set up the initial conditions of the simulated world.

## Simulation Panel:

### The Simulation Panel is a crucial component of the Darwin World Simulator, acting as the operational heart where users can actively engage with and oversee their ongoing simulations.

## Statistics:
### At any moment during the simulation, we have the ability to pause the simulation to closely examine the statistics of a specific animal, as well as to determine the dominant genotype of our creature and understand the preferred distribution of plants across the map.

## Practical features:

+ **Multi-threading Support:** Enables the application to conduct several simulations concurrently

+ **Configuration Loading and Saving:** Users can load configurations from a file to quickly set up or save their simulations.
  
+ **Daily Statistics Export to CSV:** At any moment, for each simulation, the application is capable of exporting detailed statistics of each day into a CSV file.
